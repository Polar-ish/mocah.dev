        <h1>Welcome in!</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Mocah, and this is my lonesome corner of the internet.
            I wanted somewhere that I could stow my projects, websites, games
            and thoughts for anyone to read as they please.
        </p>

            <h1>
                I'm not good at design
            </h1>
            <h2>
                And that stinks
            </h2>
            <p>
                I hope this website will help me improve my web designing
                ability. Since, I'd like to be able to place it in my portfolio
                (with this website as proof).

            <p>
                If I can get a server running with PHP on a proper web server,
                I would be able to make much more exciting things on here.
                <br> Until then, this is all you get...
